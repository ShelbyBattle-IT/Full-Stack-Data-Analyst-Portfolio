# Excel Storytelling

This section demonstrates how I use Excel as a business decision tool, not just a spreadsheet.

Focus areas:
- Translating business questions into measurable KPIs
- Rapid analysis using Pivot Tables and formulas
- Automated data cleaning with Power Query
- Decision-driven storytelling (insight → recommendation → next step)

What this section shows recruiters:
- I can quickly diagnose business performance
- I understand what executives care about
- I can prototype insights before automating them in SQL / BI tools

Example business questions explored:
- Which product categories are driving revenue decline?
- Where are margins eroding and why?
- Which regions or channels need immediate action?
