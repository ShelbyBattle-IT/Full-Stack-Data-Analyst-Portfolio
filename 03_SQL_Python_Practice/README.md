# SQL and Python Practice

This section showcases my ability to work directly with data at scale and automate analytical workflows.

SQL skills demonstrated:
- Joins (inner, left, multi-table)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions (ranking, rolling metrics)
- Subqueries for advanced filtering and aggregation

Python skills demonstrated:
- Data cleaning and validation with pandas
- Automation scripts for recurring tasks
- Logic to support alerts and data refreshes

What this section proves:
- I don’t rely on manual processes
- I can build repeatable, scalable analysis
- I design systems that make analysis easier over time
