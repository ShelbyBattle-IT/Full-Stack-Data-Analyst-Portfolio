# Executive Decks

This section contains executive-style presentations designed to support decision-making.

Methodology:
- Pyramid Principle (lead with the answer)
- Clear problem statements
- Insight-backed recommendations
- Defined next steps and business impact

What this demonstrates:
- I can communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders
- I translate data into actions, not just charts
- I think in terms of ROI, risk, and priorities

Each deck is structured to answer:
- What is happening?
- Why does it matter?
- What should we do next?
